# ‚öΩ Predicting Football Match Outcomes using Traditional Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches (Win/Draw/Loss) using traditional machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. It leverages the European Soccer Database from Kaggle, containing over 25,000 matches between 2008 and 2016. The project includes an interactive Gradio demo and is packaged with Docker for reproducibility.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development, testing, and running the Gradio demo.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following software is installed:

- Python >= 3.9  
- pip  
- Docker (for deployment)  
- git  

You can install dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

Step-by-step to run locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Football-Match-Prediction-ML.git
cd Football-Match-Prediction-ML
```

2. **Prepare the data**

```
# Download the European Soccer Database from Kaggle
# Place it in the `data/` folder
```

3. **Run preprocessing scripts**

```
python src/preprocessing.py
```

4. **Train the model**

```
python src/train_model.py
```

5. **Launch the Gradio demo**

```
python app.py
```

## Running the Tests

To ensure everything works as expected, you can run unit tests and data integrity checks.

### üß™ End-to-End Tests

These test the full pipeline from data loading to prediction:

```
pytest tests/test_pipeline.py
```

---

## Deployment

To deploy the project using Docker:

```
docker build -t football-predictor .
docker run -p 7860:7860 football-predictor
```

Then, access the Gradio app at: [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860)
