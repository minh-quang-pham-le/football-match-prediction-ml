# ‚öΩ Predicting Football Match Outcomes using Traditional Machine Learning ‚öΩ

This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches (Win/Draw/Loss) using traditional machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. It leverages the European Soccer Database from Kaggle, containing over 25,000 matches between 2008 and 2016. The project includes an interactive Gradio demo and is packaged with Docker for reproducibility.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development, testing, and running the Gradio demo.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following software is installed:

- Python >= 3.10  
- pip  
- Docker (for deployment)  
- git  

### Installing

You can install all required packages automatically via:

```
python setup.py
```

Or manually

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r docker/requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**

```
https://github.com/minh-quang-pham-le/football-match-prediction-ml.git
cd football-match-prediction-ml
```

2. **For Users who want to Run the Full Pipeline (Train + Evaluate)**

```
python run_pipeline.py
```
This script will:

3. **For Users who want to Run the Prediction App**

```
python run_app.py --mode [simple|medium|full]
```

This will launch a Gradio web interface with three available modes:
- **Simple Mode**: Select from existing matches in the test set (2015/2016 season)
- **Medium Mode**: Select teams and match date (players are automatically filled in)
- **Full Mode**: Select teams, individual players for each team, and match date

For more details about the prediction app, see [README_APP.md](README_APP.md)

- Load and clean data (data/raw/)

- Generate features (data/features/)

- Train and save model (models/)

- Evaluate performance on the training set
  

3. **For users who want to launch Gradio Demo App**

```
python demo/app.py
```

4. **For users who want Run Everything with Docker (Deployment)**

Build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t football-predictor .
```
Run the container (Gradio mode):
```
docker run -p 7860:7860 football-predictor
```
Then go to: http://localhost:7860 to access the Gradio app

## Running the Tests

To ensure everything works as expected, you can run unit tests and data integrity checks

### üß™ End-to-End Tests

These test the full pipeline from data loading to prediction:

```
pytest tests/
```
